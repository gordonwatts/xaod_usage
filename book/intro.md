# Using the ATLAS xAOD Typed Backend

Come here to learn:

- How to setup your environment to access xAOD data in ATLAS (R21)
- Collections from the xAOD that are available
- Access methods, attributes, and decorations on the xAOD Event Data Model (EDM).

This tutorial book takes for granted that you:

- Have access to an ATLAS xAOD ServiceX backend
- Know the basics about how to use ServiceX to filter, select data, etc.
- Basic knowledge of the ATLAS xAOD data model (at the level of a standard ATLAS tutorial)
- The names of the xAOD collections you are interested in, etc.

## Typed?

Normally, one does not think of Python as a `typed` language, like C++ or many other languages.
However, most Python code does not take advantage of this - a variable is always an `int` or a `string`
or similar. _Type Hints_ are the Python way of expressing this. They are a fundamental part of the modern
Python language (see [PEP 482](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0482/), [PEP 483](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/),
[PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), etc.). Typing offers several advantages:

- Various tools like [`pylance`](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release) and [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) can spot errors before the code is run
- Editors, like [`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), can give you suggestions motivated by the type definitions

Further, `func_adl` libraries can use this type information to configure the backend C++ on the fly:

- New collections can be made accessible.
- Objects that are returned by various methods can be properly interpreted by the `func_adl` C++ backend.
- Arbitrary C++ code can be downloaded and executed as part of the query to ServiceX.

For example, here is a Jupyter notebook opened in visual studio code, showing the possible collections in an event:

And here the type checker `pylance` has flagged a bad method name, and a mouse-over shows more details on the error

## Setup and config

Everything in this book can be executed and, at the time when the book was published, ran. For
this to work we need an up-to-date version of ServiceX running. We call this backend `xaod_r21` for
the C++ ATLAS xAOD backend based on the Release 21 of the ATLAS analysis software. As per normal for ServiceX, `xaod_r21` should
be defined in your `servicex.yaml` or `.servicex` file in your `$HOME` directory.

See the chapter on [configuration](ch-configuration) for more information.
